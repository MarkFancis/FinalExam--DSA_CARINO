1.Array Declaration:
The array products is declared with the const keyword, making it immutable (the reference cannot change, but its contents can be modified).

2.Arrow Function:
The function sortByPrice is declared using an arrow function syntax. It accepts an array (arr) as an argument and sorts it in ascending order.

3.Sorting Mechanism:
The Array.prototype.sort() method is used with a comparison function (a, b):
If a - b is negative, a is sorted before b.
If a - b is positive, b is sorted before a.
If a - b is 0, the order remains unchanged.

4.Function Call:
The sortByPrice function is invoked with products as the argument, and the result is logged to the console.

5.Export:
The function sortByPrice is exported as a module for external use, making it reusable in other files.
