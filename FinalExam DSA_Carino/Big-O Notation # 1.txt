1.Constants Declaration:
The array sortedInventory is defined using the const keyword, indicating that it won't be reassigned.
binarySearch is defined as a function that takes two arguments: arr (the array to search) and target (the value to find).

2.Initialization:
Variables left and right are initialized to represent the bounds of the search space:
left starts at 0 (beginning of the array).
right is intended to start at arr.length - 1 but contains a syntax error (missing =).

3.Loop Logic:
The while loop iterates as long as the left index is less than or equal to the right index, narrowing down the search space.
mid is calculated using the formula Math.floor((left + right) / 2).

4.Conditional Checks:
If arr[mid] equals the target, the function returns a success message.
If arr[mid] is less than the target, left is updated to mid + 1.
Otherwise, right is updated to mid - 1.

5.Return Statements:
If the target is found, it returns a success message.
If the loop exits without finding the target, it returns a "not found" message.

6.Export:
The function binarySearch is exported as a module for use in other files.
